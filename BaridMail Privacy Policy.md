BaridMail Privacy Policy
Effective Date: December 19, 2025

BaridMail ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use our Android app for temporary disposable emails. By using BaridMail, you agree to these practices.

Information We Collect
BaridMail is designed to minimize data collection for maximum privacy:

No Personal Data: We do not collect, store, or require your name, email, phone number, or any personal identifiers. No user accounts or sign-ups needed.

Temporary Emails Only: Generated disposable email addresses and incoming messages are handled temporarily via third-party temp mail APIs. Emails auto-expire and are not stored on our servers beyond active sessions.

Device Data (Minimal): We may access basic device info like Android ID or IP address only for app functionality (e.g., generating unique inboxes). No persistent logging.

Usage Data: Anonymized crash reports or analytics (if enabled) via Google Play services, but opt-out available in settings. No tracking of individual user behavior.

We do not request sensitive permissions like contacts, SMS, location, camera, or storage beyond what's essential for displaying emails.

How We Use Your Information
Core Functionality: To generate, monitor, and delete temp emails securely.

Improvements: Anonymized data helps debug crashes and enhance app performance.

No Marketing: No ads, no newsletters, no selling data.

Information We Share
Zero Sharing: We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.

Service Providers: Limited to temp mail APIs (e.g., for inbox generation) under strict privacy terms. They handle transient data only.

Legal Requirements: Only if required by law, with user notification where possible.

Third-Party Services
Temp mail providers (transient access only).

Google Play Services for updates/crashes (anonymized).
All comply with GDPR/CCPA where applicable.

Data Security & Retention
Emails delete automatically after use (configurable: 10min-24h).

App data cleared on uninstall.

Children's Privacy
BaridMail is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. Parents can contact us to delete any accidental data.
